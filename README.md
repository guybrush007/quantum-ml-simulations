# quantum-ml-simulations

Personal projects to learn and to explore ML/MLOps techniques applied to quantum physics. 

# quantum-entanglement-simple
- Simulation of 2-qubits (not) entangled states using QuTiP
- Implementation of entanglement witnesses (CHSH, concurrence, entropy , PPT negativity)
- Training of a Tensorflow neural network using the simulated data and the various witnesses
- Tests on maximally entangled, partially entangled and not entangled, pure or mixed states
- Building of a meta model using models from different witnesses
- Build models using TPOT AutoML too
- Using MLFLow for experiment tracking
- Using Airflow for ML Pipeline building

# quantum-entanglement-many-body
- Quantum Montecarlo simulation for many body system (1D - 2D linear spin chain)
- RBM training
