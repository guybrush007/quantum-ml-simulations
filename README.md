# quantum-ml-simulations

Personal projects to learn and to explore ML/MLOps techniques applied to quantum physics. 

# quantum-entanglement

- Simulation of 2-qubits (not) entangled states using QuTiP
- Implementation of entanglement witnesses (CHSH, concurrence, entropy and negativity)
- Training of a Tensorflow neural network using the simulated data and the various witnesses
- Tests on maximally entangled, partially entangled and not entangled, pure or mixed states

# quantum-ml-workbench

Jupyterlab application to build Quantum related ML pipelines.
